To create a Sierra tool plugin for a typical third-party tool:
1. Create an Eclipse plugin project using the Sierra Tool Plugin Project wizard
   
2. Copy the appropriate library jars to the project, and add them to the classpath via
   the Runtime tab in the Plugin Manifest Editor

3. Edit Factory.java, filling in the various TODOs
